### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__:

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Performing (2)** - Good job here! I liked that you had a wireframe, but your
user stories could be improved by having them better match the
format of role, goal, and reason, e.g.

> As a user, I want to click cards so I can see what's on the back.
> As a user, I want to see the cards that have been flipped over
> and matched so I can focus on clicking the remaining cards

* __Technical Requirements__:

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Progressing (1)** - Your app is close, but it's missing some features like
reset, and has a few bugs (e.g. if you click cards too fast.)

* __Code Quality__:

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Progressing (1)** - Your code is much improved compared to when you started
the project, but still lots of room to improve. See my in-line code comments for
more suggestions, but the main areas of focus are keeping your code neat and
tidy, with less commented out code sitting around, more careful indentation, and
clearer variable names.


* __Creativity/Interface__:

>Is your user interface easy to use and understand? Does it make sense for the problem you're solving? Does your interface demonstrate creative design?

**Progressing (1)** - Your UI is nice and simple, but I'd like to see a bit more
CSS to show off what you've learned!
